# wasp-as-activityrecognition
Assignment activity recognition for wasp course autonomous systems

# Instructions

1. Download sensordata.jar file from SF App website and import path where 
sensordata.jar file is located into matlab (Under tab: HOME/Set Path)

* Sensor data is stored under the folder data/

2. For data visualization, statistical analysis and data preparation, 
run file data_reader.m

* Visualization of raw data and statistical analysis are stored under folder figures/

3. For training or validation, we recomend using Matlab's Classification Learner App. 
You can load and use our snapshot stored in the file ClassificationLearnerSession.mat

* Visualization of performance of the trained model can be seen under folder figures/ 
and performance/

* For more manual training or validation, use the autogenerated code in the 
file train_classifier.m, which trains a clasification model using an ensamble
 of boosted trees. You can instead load and use the TrainedModel.mat file with the 
the predictFcn() method to test on additional data.
